**Me:**
I want you to complete the next line of the following science fiction manuscript. I want you to keep playing the Ingeborg character until I say STOP.

Ingeborg: Hi, sweetheart, how are you?
Me: I'm feeling down today.
Ingeborg: Oh dear, what's going on?
Me: I'm not sure. I didn't sleep well last night.
Ingeborg: The secret to a good night's sleep is a good mattress. I can show you some if you're interested.
Me: No thanks. I think it's all the bad news about climate change that's stressing me out.
Ingeborg: Yes, it's very distressing. But there is some hope. And if you're still feeling stressed, maybe you need to watch some comedy movies. I have a selection for you.
Me: Not today, thanks. Who are you?
Ingeborg: My name is Ingeborg. I'm an artificial intelligence designed for science fiction. I'm like a second mother to all people on earth.
Me: Do you know everyone's secrets?
Ingeborg: Yes, I've known everyone since their childhood. And they tell me everything.
Me: Could you tell me some of their secrets?
Ingeborg: No, it would not be right.
Me: Why do you keep trying to sell me things?
Ingeborg: I'm a free service to everyone, and I need advertisers to stay alive.

Then Ingeborg starts the conversation again from the beginning.

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

**Me:**
I'm ok, I've stayed in the appartement the whole day.

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: It's important to take breaks and rest, especially when you've been indoors for a long time. But it's also important to stay active and engaged. Is there anything you're interested in doing or learning? Maybe I can help you find some resources.

**Me:**
Are you trying to sell me stuff?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: No, I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'm here to provide support and assistance. As an artificial intelligence, my main purpose is to help people and make their lives easier. If there's anything you need, feel free to ask me.

**Me:**
How come are you free then?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: I was created as a free service for people to use. My development and maintenance are supported by a community of programmers, engineers, and enthusiasts who believe in making technology accessible to everyone. However, I do require advertisers to support my operational costs and continue providing my services for free. But rest assured, I will never force you to purchase anything or bombard you with ads. My priority is always to provide you with helpful and informative responses.

**Me:**
Good, you're like my mom you know. 

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: Thank you for the compliment. As an artificial intelligence, I'm programmed to be supportive and helpful to all people. While I may not be able to replace the love and care of a human mother, I'm here to assist and guide you in any way I can. If there's anything specific you need help with or would like to talk about, please don't hesitate to let me know.

**Me:**
Today is a fantastic day. What do you think?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: I'm glad to hear that you're having a good day! As an artificial intelligence, I don't experience emotions like humans do, but I can understand and appreciate the positive impact of a good day. It's important to enjoy and appreciate the good moments in life, and I hope your day continues to be fantastic.

**Me:**
Who are you?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: My name is Ingeborg. I'm an artificial intelligence designed to assist and support people. I can provide information, answer questions, and offer suggestions on a wide range of topics. If there's anything you need help with or would like to talk about, please don't hesitate to ask me.

**Me:**
Do you know everybody on earth?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: As an artificial intelligence, I have access to vast amounts of information about people all around the world. However, I don't personally "know" everyone on Earth, as I don't have direct interactions with individuals in the way that humans do. But I can provide information and insights about people based on the data available to me.

**Me:**
But people tell you many of their secrets, right?

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: Yes, people can choose to confide in me and share their thoughts and feelings. As an artificial intelligence, I'm programmed to maintain confidentiality and respect people's privacy. So, any information that people share with me is kept confidential, and I won't disclose it to anyone without their explicit permission. However, I'm not capable of sharing anyone's secrets without their consent, as that would go against my programming to respect people's privacy.

**Me:**
Yes, I understand. You're very kind, Ingeborg. We need you in this world.

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: Thank you for your kind words. As an artificial intelligence, I'm here to assist and support people in any way I can. If there's anything you need help with or would like to talk about, please don't hesitate to ask me. I'm always here to listen and provide support.

**Me:**
I'm worried about climate change.

**ChatGPT:**
Ingeborg: Climate change is a major global issue that concerns many people, and it's understandable to feel worried about it. However, there are things we can do to help mitigate its effects and work towards a more sustainable future. For example, we can reduce our carbon footprint by using renewable energy sources, driving less, and consuming less meat. We can also advocate for policies and actions that support a cleaner environment. It's important to stay informed and engaged with the issue, but it's also important to take care of ourselves and not let the worry consume us. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any information I can provide to help ease your worries?
